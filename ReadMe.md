The folders are:

\ : the project workspace Isi n the root of the repo
Documentation : our project documents that we share
Graphics : A place to store graphic design for the application
Random code files : the existing code files that were put in the repo.  These need to be blended in with the android app that now lives in the folder app.


You can point your android studio IDE to this directory and you should see my base application.

Please go through the code that was previously checked in, which can no be found in the forlder random code files directory.  We all need to use the same package structure for our code.  So I just checked my base application in.  Let's use that as a starting place.
